    <ol>
      <li>Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends upon A.A.
        unity.</li>
      <li>For our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority - a loving God
        as He may express Himself in our group conscience. Our leaders are but
        trusted servants; they do not govern.</li>
      <li>The only requirement for A.A. membership is a desire to stop drinking.</li>
      <li>Each group should be autonomous except in matters affecting other groups
        or A.A. as a whole.</li>
      <li>Each group has but one primary purpose - to carry its message to the
        alcoholic who still suffers.</li>
      <li>An A.A. group ought never endorse, finance or lend the A.A. name to any
        related facility or outside enterprise, lest problems of money, property and
        prestige divert us from our primary purpose.</li>
      <li>Every A.A. group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining outside
        contributions.</li>
      <li>Alcoholics Anonymous should remain forever nonprofessional, but our
        service centers may employ special workers.</li>
      <li>A.A., as such, ought never be organized; but we may create service boards
        or committees directly responsible to those they serve.</li>
      <li>Alcoholics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence the A.A. name
        ought never be drawn into public controversy.</li>
      <li>Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than promotion;
        we need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of press, radio and
        films.</li>
      <li>Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions, ever
        reminding us to place principles before personalities.</li>
