      <li>Final responsibility and ultimate authority for A.A. world services should
        always reside in the collective conscience of our whole Fellowship.</li>
      <li>The General Service Conference of A.A. has become, for nearly every
        practical purpose, the active voice and the effective conscience of our
        whole society in its world affairs.</li>
      <li>To insure effective leadership, we should endow each element of A.A. - the
        Conference, the General Service Board and its service corporations, staffs,
        committees, and executives - with a traditional "Right of
        Decision."</li>
      <li>At all responsible levels, we ought to maintain a traditional "Right
        of Participation," allowing a voting representation in reasonable
        proportion to the responsibility that each must discharge.</li>
      <li>Throughout our structure, a traditional "Right of Appeal" ought
        to prevail, so that minority opinion will be heard and personal grievances
        receive careful consideration.</li>
      <li>The Conference recognizes that the chief initiative and active
        responsibility in most world service matters should be exercised by the
        trustee members of the Conference acting as the General Service Board.</li>
      <li>The Charter and Bylaws of the General Service Board are legal instruments,
        empowering the trustees to manage and conduct world service affairs. The
        Conference Charter is not a legal document; it relies upon tradition and the
        A.A. purse for final effectiveness.</li>
      <li>The trustees are the principal planners and administrators of over-all
        policy and finance. They have custodial oversight of the separately
        incorporated and constantly active services, exercising this through their
        ability to elect all the directors of these entities.</li>
      <li>Good service leadership at all levels is indispensable for our future
        functioning and safety. Primary world service leadership, once exercised by
        the founders, must necessarily be assumed by the trustees.</li>
      <li>Every service responsibility should be matched by an equal service
        authority, with the scope of such authority well defined.</li>
      <li>The trustees should always have the best possible committees, corporate
        service directors, executives, staffs, and consultants. Composition,
        qualifications, induction procedures, and rights and duties will always be
        matters of serious concern.</li>
      <li>The Conference shall observe the spirit of A.A. tradition, taking care
        that it never becomes the seat of perilous wealth or power; that sufficient
        operating funds and reserve be its prudent financial principle; that it
        place none of its members in a position of unqualified authority over
        others; that it reach all important decisions by discussion, vote, and
        whenever possible, substantial unanimity; that its actions never be
        personally punitive nor an incitement to public controversy; that it never
        perform acts of government; that, like the Society it serves, it will always
        remain democratic in thought and action.</li>
